2.1 On average how many goals were scored per match in matches between Bayern Munich and Dortmund and is it above or below from average of scored goals in all matches?

```{r}

bvd<-bund[(bund$HOMETEAM=="Bayern Munich"&bund$AWAYTEAM=="Dortmund")|
            (bund$HOMETEAM=="Dortmund"&bund$AWAYTEAM=="Bayern Munich"),]
s<-mean(bvd$FTTG)
a<-mean(bund$FTTG)
s-a

```

This is mean that on average 0.0942 more goals scored per match between Bayern Munich and Dortmund than in all matches.

2.2 Does Bayern Munich and Dortmund affect each other?

```{r}
byr<-iamdata[iamdata$TEAM=="Bayern Munich",]
bvb<-iamdata[iamdata$TEAM=="Dortmund",]
cor(bvb$W,byr$W)
cor(bvb$L,byr$L)
cor(bvb$POINTS,byr$POINTS)
cor(bvb$POSITION,byr$POSITION)
cor(bvb$W,byr$L)
cor(bvb$L,byr$W)
cor(bvb$POSITION,byr$POINTS)
cor(bvb$POINTS,byr$POSITION)
cor(bvb$DIFF,byr$DIFF)

```

As we see this correlations are too small to conclude, that there is relation between Bayern Munich and Dortmund.
 
2.3 Do some statistical analysis on Full Time Total Goals series.

```{r}
ggplot(bund,aes(x="",y=FTTG))+geom_boxplot()+scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,15))
mean(bund$FTTG)
sd(bund$FTTG)
table(bund$FTTG)
```

As we see maximum number of goals in one match is 11, 1st quartile is 2, Median is 3, 3rd quartile is 4 and 8,9,10,11 goals in one match is outlier, mean is 2.887, standard deviation is 1.7 and 2 goals in one match appears more often.
